Hello!

You can place a file into this folder named "mods.js" for any javascript changes, or a file named "mods.css" for any CSS changes, and the files will be loaded with the game. These files will not be replaced when there are updates for Trimps.

Follow instructions from the author of your mod for installation to the Steam version.

If making your own tweaks to Javascript, please be careful never to replace any main game functions, as this could cause major problems on updates.

Full game source code available at github.com/trimps

Enjoy!
